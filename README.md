# ForClust
I attempted several methods to decrease the noise from my laptop, but none of them worked. Later, I discovered that I can manually adjust the settings of the CPU and other components in Linux. As a result, I thought of creating a program in Fortran to enhance my control over my system. The goal of this project is to create a program in Fortran that can manage and control a Linux system.
